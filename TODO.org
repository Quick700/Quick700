** TODO Find bugs with Honggfuzz
   - Currently running this on my (Calvin's) laptop. It has been 1.5
     hours and no crashes have been found.
     + Probably takes a while to find crashes...
     + May want to look into finding mutants?
* General
** TODO Mutants for httpd?
   - Could be useful for seeing how long different fuzzers take to
     find a bug that we *know* is there.
* Calvin's Personal Todo List
** TODO Read into this fapache thing. Not sure what's going on there
