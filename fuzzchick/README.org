* Introduction

  Directory for testing FuzzChick. Should be relatively easy to install:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd QuickChick
    make
    make install
  #+END_SRC

  You will need Coq, and it may prompt you to install some libraries:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    opam repo add coq-released http://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
    opam install coq.8.8.2 && opam pin add coq 8.8.2

    opam install coq-ext-lib
    opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
    opam install coq-simple-io
  #+END_SRC

  But that should be about it.

* Running FuzzChick

  There is a [[./QuickChick/examples/fuzz-ifc][examples/fuzz-ifc]] directory in QuickChick that is related
  to FuzzChick. I am currently not too sure how to run this.

  There are some comments here:

  https://github.com/Quick700/Quick700/issues/5

  Sounds like FuzzChick will compile tests as a binary tester, which
  it then runs AFL on. The binary tester will intentionally crash when
  the checker fails for a given test.
